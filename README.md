This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where the server fails to parse JSON request bodies that are empty or contain invalid JSON data.  The server should ideally handle these situations gracefully, perhaps by returning an appropriate error response or logging a more informative message.  The solution provided shows how to improve error handling and provide more informative feedback to the client.
